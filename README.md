> An entry to the GMTK Game Jam 2020

The block-matching game you don't get to play! Instead, your task is to predict the chain reactions unfolding in front you.

Each level, you're presented with a board of coloured blocks. Adjacent blocks of the same colour matching a given pattern will disappear, with other blocks falling down to fill the gaps. Predict five steps of this chain reaction to advance to the next level.

Procedurally generated levels make the game quite replayable.

Use left and right click on blocks to set up your predictions. Alternatively, you can use number keys while hovering over the block (0 removes the prediction).
